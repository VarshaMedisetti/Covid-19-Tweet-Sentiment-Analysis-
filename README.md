# Covid-19-Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis-
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding public sentiment expressed on social media platforms like Twitter is crucial for several reasons. The outbreak has not only posed significant health challenges but has also triggered widespread emotional responses and opinions among the global population. Analyzing sentiments expressed in tweets related to COVID-19 provides valuable insights into public perceptions, concerns, and reactions during this unprecedented crisis. The vast amount of unstructured text data makes it challenging to extract meaningful insights manually. Therefore, the objective of this project is to develop an automated sentiment analysis system for tweets related to COVID-19.
